<h2><b>Brain tumor segmentation using transfer learning approach.</b></h2> 

This repo is divided by two folders.</br> 
First folder, <b>python_preprocesing</b> contains all of the EDA, pre-processing and augmentation examples.
All notebooks are properly annotated. Follow the instructions. To follow these instructions BraTS data should be acquired first. 
Please, check link above.</br> 

tum-proj --- Data Aquisition, EDA, Preprocessing, Normalization. 

Patch-Extraction Pseudo 3D --- Creating pseudo 3D colorfull image from different modalities, as described by Puybareau and colleagues.

Directories of Images --- final pre-processing for optimization, augmentation, feature extraction and writing images to the hard drive.

Second folder, <b>matlab_dl</b> contains transfer learning implementation in MATLAB, specifically pre-trained VGG16 model. Code is properly annotated. Just follow the instructions inside. 

vgg16 --- MATLAB script, implementation of vgg16 for brain tumor segmentation using pseudo-3D images. 

partitionData --- MATLAB function aimed to divide data for training and validation dataset, use pixelIDs!</br>Follow instructions inside the function.

pixelLabelColorbar --- function that enables colorbars when applying masks, to understand labels.

<b>appendix</b> contains visualizations of training procedure and validation results.
